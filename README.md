# OptimizationRaytracer

This is the base code of the optimization series as seen on my youtube channel (youtube.com/c/nonumberman). Check out the other branches for the code made in the respective episodes.

To use this code, please compile/link using the latest versions of GLFW and GLEW. Place meshes in the scene using the raytracer::add_mesh() function and implement the raytracer::run() function to render.

Use this code for whatever you want, idc (:
