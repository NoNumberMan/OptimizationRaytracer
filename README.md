# OptimizationRaytracer (Epsiode 0)

This is the code we made in episode 0 of the optimization series on my youtube channel (youtube.com/c/nonumberman). Most of the relevant code can be found in the raytracer.cpp file.

To use this code, please compile/link using the latest versions of GLFW and GLEW.

Use this code for whatever you want, idc (:
